# Contributing

If you wish to contribute to the discord.js codebase or documentation, feel free to fork the repository and submit a
pull request. We use ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style, so having that set up in your editor of choice
is a great boon to your development process.

## Setup

To get ready to work on the codebase, please do the following:

1. Fork & clone the repository, and make sure you're on the **main** branch
2. Run `npm ci`
3. Code your heart out!
4. Run `npm test` to run ESLint and ensure any JSDoc changes are valid
5. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/Miko-Team/necord/compare) (Make sure you follow the [conventional commit format](https://github.com/Miko-Team/necord/blob/main/.github/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md))
